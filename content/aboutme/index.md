## Some Background Informations

I am Itay Beladev, a 16 years old Pwner& Reverser from Israel. I am playing for the international CTF team [thehackerscrew](https://thehackerscrew.team). I am currently studying @ [The Open University of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_University_of_Israel).

I started playing CTFs this year, with [pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr) and am currently ranked 37th!
I mostly do pwn & rev, but lately have been dabbling with some Crypto as well.
